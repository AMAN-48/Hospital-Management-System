# Hospital management System


This Hospital Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the operations of a hospital by integrating the key roles into a single platform. The system provides three dedicated dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and User, each with distinct functionalities:

#User Dashboard:

Users (patients) can register, login, and book appointments with doctors.

They can also view their appointment history and receive real-time updates on their status from doctors.


#Doctor Dashboard:

Doctors can view patient details and appointments by patient name.

They can update and send current status reports or treatment information to the patients directly through the system.

Doctors can also register and login/logout securely.


#Admin Dashboard:

The Admin has full control over the system.

They can add new doctors, manage specialist categories, and oversee registrations.

Admin ensures that both doctors and users are properly registered and managed.



## ‚ùì Problem Statement

 In many hospitals, patient management and appointment scheduling are still handled manually or through outdated systems, leading to inefficiencies such as long waiting times, misplaced records, limited communication between doctors and patients, and administrative burdens.

There is a need for a centralized digital system that allows administrators to manage hospital resources efficiently, doctors to access patient and appointment data in real-time, and patients to book appointments and receive updates with ease.

Therefore, this project aims to develop a web-based Hospital Management System that provides separate dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and User (Patient), enabling seamless management of appointments, doctor-patient communication, and hospital data, ultimately improving the overall healthcare service delivery.
